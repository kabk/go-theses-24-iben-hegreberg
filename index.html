					<h1 id="introduction" >Introduction</h1>
						<p>Growing up in a cold fjord in Norway, I have always been surrounded by wool. Throughout my childhood, I have been dressed from head to toe in handmade knits made by my mother and my grandmother. When I was old enough, I learned to knit from my mother, who learned to knit from my grandmother who learned to knit from my great-grandmother, who probably learned to knit from my great-great-grandmother.</p>
						<p>Knitting, like other textile crafts, is a technique that evolved from our basic need of having clothing to stay warm. In today's society, we are no longer dependent on being able to craft our own clothing because of the availability of mass-produced clothing and other textile goods. Therefore, continuing a tradition my family has had for centuries, becomes a way for me to connect with the past and my female ancestors. Knitting by hand becomes like tracing threads through the past.</p>
						<p>While knitting has played an important role in shaping my identity, textile crafts have been intertwined with the construction of the feminine stereotype. In Western society, women have traditionally been confined to the domestic sphere, where it was her job to take care of the house, clean, make food,  nurture the family, as well as making clothes and other textiles. Even though more than a hundred years have passed since the start of the Women's liberation movement, textile craft is predominantly a gendered activity. A survey from Norway from 2017 shows that 48 percent of women have knitting as a hobby while only 3 percent of men have knitting as a hobby, reflecting how gender roles still influence societal expectations.</p>
						<p>Through my own experience with knitting, I’m conscious of it’s close relationship to femininity, prompting me to question its history. As femininity is shaped by society’s construction of gender roles, I wonder how textile craft became associated with femininity?</p>

					<h1 id="narratives-of-textile-craft-in-prehistory">Narratives of textile craft in prehistory</h1>
					<h2 id="the-story-of-humans">The story of humans</h2>
						<p>Tools define us. It is what makes us humans, different from other species. The earliest and most important of pre-historic man's tools was the spear. Or that’s how the story of apes becoming humans goes. In her essay, <em>The Carrier Bag Theory of Fiction</em>, Ursula K. Le Guin challenges this idea, suggesting that the first of man’s tool wasn’t a spear, but a basket:</p>
						<p><em>Many theorizers feel that the earliest cultural inventions must have been a container to hold gathered products and some kind of sling or net carrier.<a class="reference" href="#fn1">[^1]</a></em></p>
						<p>The story of the basket is new. Yet old. The basket becomes a metaphor for the stories of people's lives that were not told. It represents the collective, the gatherers gathering oats in a field of oats; while the spear represents the Hero, the brave one, who killed the mammoth in the epic fight, where he became a winner, he became a conqueror. Ursula suggests that the narrative of the hero and the spear has dominated the narrative of prehistory, due to its compelling rhetorical power.</p>
						<p>How we tell the story of the evolution of humans reflects current values. When history is dominated by stories of men winning, killing and conquering, we forget that we were also gatherers, nurturers.</p>
						<p><em>These reconstructions of the imagined stereotypical activities of prime-age males leave us in the proverbial outer darkness as to what the Paleolithic “silent majority”—the mates, children, and parents of such brave prehistoric men—may have been doing with their lives in addition to admiring and assisting them.</em><a class="reference" href="#fn2">[^2]</a></p>
						<p>Our reconstructions of history are biased. What stories are we missing? For example the story of textile craft, a necessary part of communal survival throughout history. One of the factors of why stories of the softer parts of pre-history have been less dominant, lies in the materiality of the objects. Stone, metals, or ivory are hard materials that create hard objects, which are resilient to the test of time. On the other hand, are the slings, the nets, the baskets, the clothing, which are soft and vulnerable, and they perish. Or at best, they leave traces.</p>
					<h2 id="prehistoric-narratives-of-textile">Prehistoric narratives of textile</h2>
						<p>The earliest  <mark id="traces">artifact</mark>. artifact that shows traces of textile craft is an imprint of woven fabric made from plants in a piece of ceramic. These imprints were discovered during the 1990s and were dated to 24000 to 29000 B.P., and they showed that humans mastered textile craft long before what was heretofore known. One of the archeologists who excavated the site was Olga Soffer, who is a Professor of Anthropology and one of the leading researchers on perishable materials. As archeologists up until then did not know that humans were able to make textiles from fiber that early in history, this discovery brought a new perspective on earlier findings. </p>
						<p>One of these is the <em>Venus of Willendorf</em>. She is part of a «collection» of figurines mainly found in Europe, dating from a period of 40,000 to 10,000 years ago. As the Venus Figurines are one of the most known objects from pre-historic times, there have been many theories of what these figurines mean, what they represented, and what their purpose was. Who were these beautifully cut ladies with no feet nor face? The early and prevailing theories had an androcentric view, giving the importance of the figurines to their «sexual» features. The conclusion was drawn that the figurines were connected to fertility and sexuality.<a class="reference" href="#fn3">[^3]</a> </p>
						<p>The <mark id="venus">Venus of Willendorf</mark> is the center of an ongoing archeological debate specific to her, her head. is extremely detailed and characteristic, and the question that has been discussed is, what exactly is on her head? For a long time, the consensus has been that it portrays a stylized hairdo, but the discovery of textiles from her time shed new light on her head. Olga Soffer, who found the first imprints of textile, has researched the Venus, suggesting that it may be a hat made from woven textile.<a class="reference" href="#fn4">[^4]</a> Soffer’s suggestion that her hat is woven, not only sheds new light on one of the most recognized and important symbols of pre-history, it also challenges the traditional narratives regarding women’s role in pre-history. </p>
						<p>Her criticism is also a reaction to the dominating androcentric perspective in archeology. The Venus figurines have been analyzed through <em>the male gaze</em>, it was taken for granted that the figurines were made by men and for men. Why her boobs are given more importance than her hat, reflects our society’s value of women’s biological features, as well as it reflects the devaluation of women’s labor. Textile craft in the past is not given a place in history, reflecting how textile craft is not given importance today. By implementing current values and stereotypes onto ancient symbols, we are justifying our current social constructs by arguing «This is how it's always been». </p>
						<p>Prehistory is a long time ago, all that is left are merely traces. We will never be able to create a full picture of the past by looking at traces. We will never know if textile craft was women’s work or how it was used to construct gender roles. But the way we construct narratives from these traces plays a role in shaping societal structures today. The narrative of human history alienates me. I connect with the story of the basket, of the gatherer, of the collective. But I know little about this story. I can visualize being a man and a hunter; my spear would either be made from stone, iron, or bronze, depending on if I lived in the stone-age, iron-age, or bronze-age, anyhow, I would hunt, and after that I would probably find a cave and paint my heroic story, knowing my grandchildren would tell my story long after I’m gone. But being a woman, I can hardly visualize that story, it’s a blurry image, a blurry basket with blurry berries. It is the blurry vision of the past that is my motivation to write this thesis. My goal is to gain a clearer idea of how textile craft has been constructed as inherently feminine.</p>

					<h1 id="mythological-threads">Mythological threads</h1>
					<h2 id="spinning-goddesses-in-norse-mythology">Spinning goddesses in Norse Mythology</h2>
						
					<div class="myth">
						<p>In the beginning, there existed nothing, not earth or sky, neither sun nor moon. The only thing that existed, was cold and heat. There was <em>Nivlheim</em>, in the north, the land of frost and fog. And in the south, <em>Muspelheim</em>, an ocean of burning flames. Then there was the place where light and darkness met, <em>Ginnungagap</em>, where life would see its beginning.  </p>
						<p>In <em>Ginnungagap</em>, the heat from <em>Muspelheim</em> melted the ice from <em>Nivlheim</em>. Ice turned to water turned to life. Life was a giant, Ymir, and a cosmic cow, Audumla, and later came the gods. From Ymir's sweat a herd of giants came into life, so many that the gods decided to kill Ymir. From Ymir's body the gods created the earth:<br>his legs became mountains and stone;<br>his blood turned rivers;<br>lakes and oceans;<br>plants and grass grew became of his hair;<br>and his skull became the firmament;<br>his shattered brain<br>painted the sky with clouds and stars.</p>
						<p>The home of humans was called <em>Midgard</em>, and in the middle of <em>Midgard</em> the Gods built their home, <em>Åsgard</em>, and in the middle of <em>Åsgard</em> the Gods planted a tree, <em>Yggdrasil</em>. Its roots spread far and the branches reached all the way to heaven. Each day, the Norns Urðr, Verðandi, and Skuld, come pouring water from the well of knowledge on the roots to keep <em>Yggdrasil</em> alive. </p>
						<p>Urðr is the past, the origin. Verðandi is the present and represents what is created in the world. Skuld is the future and alludes to the causes of everything that happens, and will happen - the inevitable - destiny. For each baby that is born, human or God, the three Norns spin a thread of fate, deciding the destiny of the newborn. A long thread for a long life, a short thread for a short life, a knot here or there or no knot, entwining threads with other threads, fates encountering other fates, entwined destinies; creating a tapestry of Urðr or fate.</p>
					</div>
						<p>The Norns, goddesses in Norse Mythology, held godlike powers executed through the spinning of threads. A finished thread of fate represents the course of a life. The Norns possessed maybe the ultimate power, for what could be more powerful than deciding the course of a person's life? The Norns represented the past, the present and the future, spinning them together to create destinies.</p>
						<p>The act of spinning thread is a common metaphor for predestined fates in ancient mythologies. Erich Neumann, a German psychologist and philosopher, as well as a student of Carl Jung, wrote the book The <em>Great Mother: An Analysis of the Archetype</em>. Here he analyzed Jung's Great Mother archetype; the archetypal mother image rooted in the collective unconscious. In his book, he discusses the symbolism of the spinning goddesses:</p>
						<p><em>And because &quot;reality&quot; is wrought by the Great Weavers, all such activities as plaiting, weaving and knotting belong to the fate-governity activity of the woman, who [...], is a spinner and weaver in her natural aspect.</em><a class="reference" href="#fn5">[^5]</a></p>
					

					<h2 id="a-softer-point-of-view">A softer point of view</h2>
						<p>Neumann suggests that textile crafts such as weaving are connected to the archetype of The Great Mother, which refers to the stereotype we have of mothers. A mother is nurturing, caring, and this is materialized through the spinning of thread. She cares for her children by making clothing and keeping them warm and protected. This stereotype is then translated into the world of myths. Although the representations clearly link textile craft with femininity and therefore construct an idea of a feminine ideal, it is the spinning of thread that gives the goddesses their power. Could this reflect a culture where, even though there were clear gender roles, feminine labor held great value? Or maybe it even reflected a more matriarchal society, where women had power in decision-making?</p>
						<p>According to Jenny Jochens, a Danish professor of Old Norse Society,<a class="reference" href="#fn6">[^6]</a> Viking society was patriarchal, but the myths may be traces of a different society:</p>
						<p><em>Literary vestiges of fertility goddesses and other signs of strong female power lurk beneath the surface of texts that embody myth and history from the Viking period.</em><a class="reference" href="#fn7">[^7]</a></p>
						<p>Although powerful goddesses in mythology don’t necessarily reflect powerful women in society, they may symbolize the significance of textile craft. Despite spinning thread being connected with femininity and motherhood, it represented a form of power, not weakness. Just like the Venus figurines, the way we view Norse Mythology is reflected by how we structure society today. Norse mythology is often associated with raiding Vikings or far-right extremists. The softer sides of Norse mythology, like the Norns spinning threads, are rarely mentioned. If we would view Norse mythology from a softer point of view, maybe we could understand the value put in spinning thread.</p>
					<h2 id="entangling-community">Entangling community</h2>
						<p>As the threads spun by the norns represented the life of a person, maybe the entangling of threads symbolizes the connection between people. An entangling of two threads could be seen as an entangling of two fates, maybe a romantic relationship or friendship, while an entangling of multiple threads could be the creation of a community. Entangling threads could then be seen as a metaphor for human connection.</p>
						<p>The act of entangling threads, textile craft, is often done together with multiple people. When you do craft together you learn from each other or make something together. Its practical nature transcends backgrounds, language or age, because it is about the shared interest in making and making it together. Therefore, making textile craft can create a space for connection.</p>
						<p>Knitting has offered a space for me to connect with my family and friends in Norway. Knitting is not only a tool to stay warm, but it’s been a way for me and my family to make stronger connections by sharing knowledge through generations, as well as a way to connect the past to the present. In the article Crafting Community,<a class="reference" href="#fn8">[^8]</a> the authors write on the meaning of textile and craft: </p>
						<p><em>Textiles are passed down from one generation to another, connecting us to our families and communities,[…].</em></p>
						<p>When I moved to The Hague in 2020, Covid was peaking, and it was difficult to socialize and make connections. Therefore I organized what I called Knit’n Sip. I wanted it to be a knitting club in combination with a get-together with alcohol, to create a space for creating social bonds and cute hats. As motivated as I was, the alcohol turned out to be a bad idea, and there was too much chatting and too little knitting for the knitting club to survive. Although the club maybe wasn’t that successful, I believe it was able to create an atmosphere that invited personal connection. Maybe the making eased the talking, maybe it was the alcohol, or maybe it simply was the perfect excuse to bring people together:)</p>

					<h1 id="why-was-mary-knitting-">Why was Mary knitting?</h1>
					<h2 id="the-construction-of-the-feminine">The construction of the feminine</h2>
						<p>In the book <em>The Subversive Stitch</em>, Rozsika Parker writes about embroidery from a feminist point of view. She focuses on how it has been a means of educating women into the feminine ideal, but also how it has provided a weapon against the constraints of femininity.<a class="reference" href="#fn9">[^9]</a> Inspired by Parker I would like to first define the words Feminine and The Feminine Stereotype, which I have been using and will be using later on. Feminine is a set of constructed notions imposed by society, either embraced or resisted by the individual. The Feminine Stereotype refers to a collection of traits assigned to women, against which their actions are constantly evaluated:</p>
						<p><em>The feminine stereotype categorises everything women are and everything we do as entirely, essentially and eternally feminine, denying differences between women according to our economic and social position, or our geographical and historical place.</em><a class="reference" href="#fn10">[^10]</a></p>
					<h2 id="the-image-of-the-knitting-mother">The image of the knitting mother</h2>
						<p>The image of the Feminine Stereotype in Europe has for centuries been that of the Virgin Mary. Mary was constructed to be the epitome of the feminine through the establishment of Christianity. Mother of God, yet a virgin, she was subverted into something unattainable. Powerless over her own body, her own destiny, yet she became one of the most important symbols of our culture.  </p>
						<p>The person Mary was not only subverted into a virgin mother, but she was also subverted into a knitter. Knitting is a rather new invention, and it was most definitely invented after Mary’s time. Surprisingly, the first depictions we have of knitting in Europe are actually medieval  <mark id="madonna">paintings of Mary knitting</mark> something for the Baby Jesus.  </p>
						<p>Why was Mary portrayed knitting? Because of her influential image, she was used to reflect what the church thought the ideal woman should be. In this case, it may have been the church’s way to inspire women to knit. In this way the church constructed knitting as an activity connected with femininity and motherhood, because she was not only knitting, she was knitting a tunic for Jesus. The tunic is reputed to be the sole garment that Jesus ever wore, believed to possess mystical properties and to have grown alongside him.<a class="reference" href="#fn11">[^11]</a> Consequently, the knitted tunic symbolizes the materialization of maternal love, while the act of knitting itself becomes an expression of love.</p>
						<p><em>[...]the oblique thread runs through the center of the Madonna where the radiant child is growing, and thus the act of spinning regains it's true and original meaning: the mother becomes the spinning goddess of destiny; the child becomes the fabric of her body.</em><a class="reference" href="#fn12">[^12]</a></p>
					<h2 id="does-a-sweater-hold-the-love-of-a-knitting-mother-">Does a sweater hold the love of a knitting mother?</h2>
						<p>If knitting is an act of love and a sweater is the materialization of that love, do knitted sweaters carry the connotation of being an object made out of love? Criminals in Norway definitely seem to think so.</p>
						<p>Three of the most famous and notorious criminals showed up in traditional knitted sweaters during their trials.<a class="reference" href="#fn13">[^13]</a> Why? Is it a token of good luck? I imagine they would need it. Or - is it to create an image of them as innocent, a normal person just like yourself (or like Jesus), but, accused of a crime they did not commit! Is it just a trick, a play, for us to think that they too, were once innocent children loved by their mother, a mother who knitted them a sweater to keep them warm when the ground turned to ice and the wind was howling?  </p>
						<p>Even though knitted sweaters did not save  <mark id="criminals">the accused</mark> from their judgment, their decision to wear them suggests that a knitted sweater has connotations of positive attributes, like innocence, perhaps coming from a sense of maternal love.</p>

					<h1 id="detangling-gender-roles">Detangling gender roles</h1>
					<h2 id="feminist-critique-of-domesticity">Feminist critique of domesticity</h2>
						<p>Throughout the 20th century, the role of textile craft as a means for constructing femininity radically changed, as it became a tool for the feminist movement. During the suffragette movement in England, embroidery was used for expressing political statements. They used embroidery to evoke femininity, but as a means of women's strength, not weakness.<a class="reference" href="#fn14">[^14]</a> While the suffragettes didn’t use textile craft to deconstruct the connection between feminism and textile craft, during the second wave of feminism it was used as a tool to detangle this relationship.</p>
						<p>The second wave of feminism catalyzed after the golden era of the housewife, amidst a time of anti-war and civil rights movement. The central idea was that the patriarchy structurally suppresses women and a radical change was needed.<a class="reference" href="#fn15">[^15]</a> Society was structured in a binary matter, separating male and female through the domestic and the public. The goal was to reconstruct women’s position in society, through focusing on political and cultural injustices. Inventions like the pill, where women gained control over their reproductive systems, as well as the liberation of abortion laws, gave women the freedom to enter into the public sphere.</p>
						<p>As these binaries were deconstructed, activities associated with the domestic sphere were reconstructed. Feminists utilized the marginalized culture of women that was formerly confined between the four walls of the home, making what was domestic, public. Textile craft was one of these practices that was subverted as something that made women submissive, into a tool to deconstruct gender roles. </p>
					<h2 id="ancient-threads-as-a-tool-for-deconstructing-the-patriarchy">Ancient threads as a tool for deconstructing the patriarchy</h2>
						<p>One way textile craft was used as a political tool, was by making clothes. The making, the sewing, knitting, crocheting were of a domestic nature, but the clothing was a way to promote political statements outside the limits of the house. It became a materialization of their political agenda. As well as being a tool to deconstruct gender roles, it was a way of rebelling against the capitalistic agenda, as consumerist, profit-driven society was seen as part of the patriarchy.</p>
						<p> <mark id="hons">Hønsestrikk, or "chicken knit",</mark> was a movement during the 70s that used knitting as a political tool. It was inspired by the idea that everyone should be able to knit their own clothing without the need to buy manufactured patterns. «Chicken knit&quot; utilized traditional knitting and subverted it into a technique that fostered creative freedom as well as amateurism, making it untraditional. By reappropriating traditional methods and visual language, the relationship between the past and the present was reconstructed.<a class="reference" href="#fn16">[^16]</a> Women’s domestic role of the past became connected with women’s position in the future. The second wave of feminism was not about disregarding female traditions to make them fit into a patriarchal society, but rather giving it new value as a part of female identity. </p>
						<p> <mark id="lisa">Lisa Anne Aurbach</mark>, an artist working with knitted imagery, often utilizes traditional symbols in her art. She combines ancient symbols with slogans and words in a satirical and political way.<a class="reference" href="#fn17">[^17]</a> During the 2008 elections in the US, Aurbach made a sweater where she combined a political statement (LET THE PEOPLE RULE!) with the symbol of <em>night ladies</em>. The n<em>ight ladies</em> are a traditional symbol in Norwegian knitting culture, which are said to symbolize an ancient mother figure, representing strong women that go against the grain.<a class="reference" href="#fn18">[^18]</a> An ancient symbol representing strong women, could it be an old feminist symbol? It suggests that knitting might have been an arena for empowerment before the feminist movement. Knitting would have been a way for women to express themselves creatively within their own culture. So maybe some of these historical knitters chose to knit strong female figurines. So Aurbach’s use of the «night ladies» could reflect a desire to honor the significance of knitting in women’s lives, and as a tool of expression.</p>

				<div id="conclusion" class="chapter">
					<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
						<p>A contemporary artwork that deals with the complicated relationship between the feminine and textile craft, is the sculpture <em>Maman</em> by the artist Louise Bourgeois.<a class="reference" href="#fn19">[^19]</a> The sculpture is an ode to her mother who was a weaver, through the symbolic image of nature’s own weaver, the spider.<a class="reference" href="#fn20">[^20]</a> Bourgeois navigates the ambivalence of the portrayal of textile craft through the spider, safe and dangerous, strong and weak. The spider embodying these dichotomies and reflects the narrative of the nurturing, spinning mother figure.</p>
						<p>As Louise Bourgeois reflects on the role of textile craft in relation to the mother role, artists Charlotte Rhode and Vera van de Seyp delve into the effects of new technology on the construction of the female role. In their exhibition <em>A Guide To Softer Ware</em>, they deconstruct languages of instruction used in domestic appliances targeting women, and YouTube videos, to unravel binary notions on gender. Through the use of materials like knit in combination with metal and soap, they question the «softness» historically assigned to certain materials. In the exhibition they touch upon the materiality of gender roles as well as the influence of technology directed at women.<a class="reference" href="#fn21">[^21]</a></p>
						<p>It is the softness of threads I have tried to unravel in my thesis. The threads of my thesis are soft and delicate, but are also vulnerable. As these threads have decayed throughout time, the narrative of women’s role in society has as well. To unravel the blurry picture of textile threads throughout history, I have woven a narrative of how textile craft has played a role in constructing gender roles, but also how textile craft was a tool for female empowerment, and became a tool for deconstructing the patriarchy. </p>
						<p>The tradition of textile craft is still associated with the feminine, carrying with it the complexity of women’s history intertwined with the construction of the feminine stereotype. It is within the gathering, detangling and re-entangling of these traces of threads that there lies a source of power. Their complexity is where there is space for new narratives to be woven, that can empower as well as transcend gendered stereotypes. Through reclaiming textile craft we can challenge the relationship between threads and women, and create space for voices that have been marginalized. Inspired by my own rhythmic click of needles, I have found stories of resilience, of sisterhood, of liberation. The materiality of the feminine has transformed from constraint to possibility. No longer a mere stereotype; a canvas has emerged—a canvas where voices, sometimes marginalized, sometimes liberated, have found a new expression. And so, as I finish off this here thesis, I know I will continue to thread my needles with more knowledge, more hope,
							<br>stitch<br>by stitch.</p>
